Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial tissues, and cancers caused by the high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models.

We describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells. These tissues have been used for microscopic visualization, scanning-electron microscopy, and large -omics studies to gain insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life cycle, and host-pathogen interactions.

Papillomaviruses are a diverse family of double-stranded DNA viruses with an epithelial tropism, infecting both cutaneous and mucosal epithelia of vertebrate hosts, including humans. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are ubiquitous infectious agents in human populations ( Schiffman et al., 2016 ) and the most common sexually transmitted pathogen ( Satterwhite et al., 2013 ). Oncogenic HPV infections are responsible for a staggering ~5% of human cancers ( de Martel et al., 2020 ; Zapatka et al., 2020 ). In addition to being responsible for virtually all cervical cancers, the incidence of HPV-associated oral cancers has dramatically increased during recent years ( Chaturvedi et al., 2011 ; Marur et al., 2010 ), making oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) the most common HPV-related malignancy in the United States ( Eisenberg et al., 2018 ). Of note, most HPV-positive OPSCCs arise in the tonsil crypts.

Following the initial infection of basal cells, the HPV DNA is amplified and established as a low copy number extrachromosomal genome. Within these actively dividing cells, the HPV genome replicates alongside the host genome. As part of the cellular differentiation cycle, infected cells detach from the basement membrane and enter the suprabasal epithelial layer. Unlike uninfected cells, the expression of the viral E6 ( Duffy et al., 2003 ; Kranjec et al., 2017 ; Morgan et al., 2018 ) and E7 ( Bodily et al., 2011 ; Flores et al., 2000 ; MÃ¼ller et al., 1999 ) proteins promotes unscheduled cell cycle progression, supporting continuous viral replication. As the cells continue to differentiate, increased expression of the E1 and E2 replication proteins leads to a transition towards productive viral DNA amplification ( Sakakibara et al., 2013 ). Finally, within the terminally differentiated layers of the epithelium, the viral capsid proteins (L1, Buck et al., 2013 ); and L2, Wang & Roden, 2013 ) are synthesized, leading to virion assembly. This synchronized gene expression implies that the completion of the viral life cycle requires the three-dimensional stratified epithelium.

Keratinocytes in the different strata of the differentiated tissue must coordinate their gene expression to fulfill specific and dynamic functions during cellular differentiation. At the stratum level, expression of many of the cellular genes are known, but how spatio-temporal gene expression is regulated is a topic of intense investigation ( Cavazza et al., 2016 ; Finnegan et al., 2019 ; Joost et al., 2016 ; Klein et al., 2017 ; Lopez-Pajares et al., 2015 ; Rubin et al., 2019 ). Modeling the physiologically relevant tissues will be critical to further our understanding of the viral life cycle.

The methods described in this protocol will outline two distinct and complementary approaches to reliably and reproducibly generate and characterize 3D tissues. By modeling the complexity of the full-thickness epithelium, these culture methods address a significant limitation of two-dimensional monolayer cultures. These culture models have been shown to faithfully recapitulate many morphological and physiological characteristics of tissue in vivo . These cultures not only preserve the cellular architecture of the cervical or tonsillar tissue but also respond to external stimuli in ways that mimic the response in the in vivo microenvironment ( Asselineau & Prunieras, 1984 ; Kopan et al., 1987 ; Radtke et al., 2012 ; Radtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012 ).

We provide methods to successfully isolate oral and cervical cells from donor-derived tissues, grow these cells into 3D epithelial tissues, and characterize them through a series of microscopic (histological, scanning electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence) and transcriptome-based analyses ( Fig. 1 ). Support Protocol 1 describes the isolation of primary epithelial cells (keratinocytes) from patient-derived tissues (e.g., cervical biopsies and tonsillectomies). These primary cultures are maintained as monolayers in Support Protocol 2 and screened for HPV DNA by PCR in Support Protocol 3 . Basic Protocols 1 and 2 describe two distinct methods to generate 3D cultures: organotypic rafting or rotating wall vessel bioreactor. Cells and materials for Basic Protocol 2 are prepared using Support Protocol 4 (to grow and maintain cells) as well as Support Protocols 5 and 6 (to prepare the bioreactor and carrier beads used). An array of host differentiation and viral life cycle characterization techniques are detailed in Basic Protocol 3 (histology), Basic Protocols 3 and 4 (immunofluorescence for raft tissues or rotating wall vessel tissues, respectively), Basic Protocol 6 (electron microscopy), and Support Protocol 7 (RNA extraction) coupled with Basic Protocol 7 (RT-qPCR).



Flowchart of all protocols described in this protocol for preparing, culturing, and characterizing 3D oral and cervical tissue models for studying interactions between HPV and the infected host. The dotted line connecting Support Protocol 1 to Basic Protocol 2 indicates that, with proper optimization, it should be feasible to culture primary cells in the Rotating wall vessel bioreactor.

CAUTION : Human tissues, cells, and HPV virions are a potential biohazard. Laboratory personnel should follow all biosafety and ethical guidelines relevant to local facilities, institutions, and governing bodies to properly acquire and handle donor-derived human samples that may contain pathogenic microorganisms. Appropriately trained individuals should conduct all work in accordance with your local guidelines and regulations. Human papillomavirus is considered a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) pathogen ( Dunne et al., 2014 ; Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) ) and since 3D raft cultures are capable of producing infectious viral particles within the superficial layer (as virus-laden squames), BSL-2 precautions (e.g., personal protective equipment and using a biosafety cabinet) must be taken while handling cultures. In addition to good laboratory practice and aseptic technique, these precautions ensure reader safety and preserve the quality of results by limiting contamination.

Keratinocytes are the predominant cell type that comprises stratified epithelia and can be isolated directly from patient-derived donor tissues from anatomic sites (e.g., oral and cervical epithelia) relevant to the HPV life cycle. This protocol provides detailed steps to isolate these primary cells from donor specific tissues. These tissues should be isolated by qualified medical personnel in accordance with institutional and Federal human protection guidelines. Tissues and isolated cell lines are a biosafety level 2 pathogen and should be handled accordingly. As an alternative, primary keratinocytes are available commercially.

In collaboration with clinical personnel, collect relevant donor tissues and place in 50 ml conical tubes, submerging the tissues (e.g., whole tonsils, hysterectomies, or cervical biopsies) in transport media.

More starter material, with greater epithelial surface area, will yield more keratinocytes and a greater chance of success. Ideally start with at least 10 mm Ã 10 mm of tissue. We have successfully used this protocol with smaller input (e.g., small cervical biopsies: < 5 mm of tissue).

Rinse tissue once in 1X D-PBS.

Perform this and all subsequent steps at room temperature (unless otherwise stated for incubations) and in a biosafety cabinet, adhering to aseptic technique.

Observe gross morphology, measure tissue dimensions, and photograph for records.

In a 10 cm dish, use forceps and scalpel with blade to remove the underlying hypodermis and loose connective tissue as much as possible while leaving the epithelial lining/casing intact (see Fig. 2 ).

It is critical that the epithelial portion of the tissue is not discarded, as this contains the keratinocytes. The goal of this step is to remove as much of the non-epithelial tissue as possible so that a pure culture can be achieved.

Dissect the tissue into smaller pieces (< 10 mm in size).

Place the tissue piece(s) in the wells of a 6-well plate, ensuring they are not overly crowded and can lay flat (and that they separate donor tissues are kept apart), and cover using 2 ml room temperature dispase II (2.4 U/ml in HBSS, with antibiotics and antimycotic added: penicillin and streptomycin at 1X, and amphotericin B at 0.625 Î¼g/ml).

Incubate tissue overnight at 4Â°C (~16 hours).

Arrows depict the epithelial casing (it is critical that this portion be kept, as it contains the keratinocytes) and the underlying hypodermis (and lymphoid) tissue.

Primary human keratinocytes are used to seed 3D raft cultures described in Basic Protocol 1 . Our lab cultures these cells in co-culture with terminally differentiated J2 fibroblast feeder cells as described by Rheinwald and Green ( Rheinwald & Green, 1975b ). This protocol describes how to culture and expand these primary cells.

Culture J2 fibroblasts in J2 medium using standard sub-culturing techniques (see Current Protocols article: Takashima, 2001 ).

Critical. Cells should be used at low passage. J2 cell morphology should be monitored to avoid transformation of the feeder culture.

Plate 1 Ã 10 6 feeders on a 10-cm dish and allow them to attach and spread overnight in a 37Â°C CO 2 incubator.

Irradiate cells with a dose of 6000R.

Change the medium to complete F-media and plate 200,000 primary cells (e.g., from Support Protocol 1, Step 10) onto the irradiated feeder monolayer.

ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) can be added to these cultures at a final concentration of 10 Î¼M to conditionally immortalize these primary epithelial cells ( Chapman et al., 2010 , 2014 ). It is critical that Y-27632 is removed before differentiating the cells using raft or RWV technologies.

Replace the media every 48 hours until cells reach 85â90% confluency.

Critical. Cells should grow in individual colonies and should not contact neighboring colonies.

Remove 10 cm plate of primary epithelial cells (e.g., human tonsillar keratinocytes, HTKs; or human cervical keratinocytes, HCKs) from the incubator and confirm by microscope that they are ready to harvest: sub-confluent, just before colonies start to touch.

If this is the first passage of the isolated cells it is important that you preserve their viability and make sufficient cryovial stocks. The majority of the cells harvested should be used for making these stocks, continued culturing, or for experiments or other molecular extractions. Only a small number of cells (< 10 6 ) will be needed for DNA isolation.

In a biosafety cabinet, use a Pasteur pipette to vacuum aspirate the media from the cells, using the edge of the plate to avoid scraping the surface layer of cells.

Add 5 ml of Versene to the plate using a serological pipette, ensure full coverage by rocking back and forth and side-to-side, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min, then pipette the Versene up and down over the cells to help remove the feeder cells. Confirm by microscope that the feeders lift from the plate. It may be necessary to slightly agitate the plate by rocking back and forth, taking care not to spill the contents.

Versene will cause the J2 fibroblast feeder cells to detach whilst leaving the keratinocytes adhered.

Vacuum aspirate the Versene and suspended J2 feeder cells.

Rinse the cells in 5 ml D-PBS to help remove any residual J2 feeder cells.

Vacuum aspirate the D-PBS and any residual feeder cells.

Add 3 ml of 37Â°C 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, ensure full coverage of the surface of the plate by rocking back and forth and side-to-side, and incubate at 37Â°C until keratinocyte colonies are dissociated and detached from the plate (~5 to 10 min). Check by microscope often to ensure cells do not remain in trypsin longer than necessary.

Add 7 ml of F-media to inactivate the trypsin, pipette up/down, rinsing the plate, to create a cell suspension, and transfer this 10 ml total volume to a 50 ml conical tube. These cells can be counted, to determine the number of cells per ml, and used in downstream protocols (for seeding the basal keratinocyte layer in Basic Protocol 1 ; for PCR-based HPV screening in Support Protocol 3 ; and as a 2D monolayer control for RNA extraction in Support Protocol 7 and RT-qPCR in Basic Protocol 7 ).

HPV infections are prevalent. As such, it is possible that the primary human oral or cervical epithelial cells were infected at the time of isolation. This protocol uses a well-characterized degenerate primer PCR to amplify a 450 bp fragment of the L1 gene ( Manos et al., 1989 ; Tachezy et al., 1994 ). This PCR can detect a wide array of HPV types. Since we typically experimentally infect these primary cells with HPV virions, we only use cell lines that are negative for HPV sequences.

Calculate the required volume of cell suspension needed for DNA isolation.

We find that starting with 7.5 Ã 10 5 cells for DNA isolation will typically yield ~10 to 20 Î¼g of purified DNA: 50 to 100 ng/Î¼l of 200 Î¼l eluate.

Centrifuge cells 150 Ã g for 7 min.

Aspirate the supernatant carefully, without disturbing the pellet, then resuspend in 5 ml D-PBS to wash.

Centrifuge 150 Ã g for 7 min.

Aspirate supernatant, then proceed with DNA isolation (cell lysis).

If you wish to perform DNA isolation at a future time you can flash freeze this pellet of cells in liquid nitrogen and store at â80Â°C. The cells will no longer be viable, but the DNA should remain stable, and we recommend flash-freezing and storing at such low temperatures in case you also need to preserve the samples for RNA isolation.

Extract DNA using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit following instructions.

We elute with 2 Ã 100 Î¼l pre-warmed (56Â°C) molecular-grade nuclease-free water.

Measure DNA concentration and purity spectrophotometrically, using the same elution buffer as a blank.

Concentration will depend on several factors, including the number of cells used for extraction, elution volume used, and the overall success of the cell lysis and DNA isolation procedure. Refer to your DNA isolation kit troubleshooting guide for tips on improving yield and purity.

Run the gel until the dye front is 2/3 down the gel.

Stain gel using Ethidium Bromide or other DNA stain.

This protocol highlights the steps taken to generate a full-thickness 3D organotypic raft tissue. First, we establish a dermal equivalent containing collagen and fibroblasts. A basal layer of keratinocytes (HPV-positive or negative) is seeded onto this dermal equivalent. Finally, we will lift these rafts to the air-liquid interface and allow the tissue to differentiate for several weeks. We will show examples of human foreskin, human cervical, and human tonsillar epithelia. The cervical cells were infected with HPV18 before starting the differentiation process. We will demonstrate that, despite using the same method, the organotypic tissues display features reminiscent of the original tissue.

Human fibroblasts hTERT immortalized (e.g., HFF-hTERT RRID:CVCL_VC40).

Alternatively, can use mouse J2/3T3 or primary human fibroblasts, either foreskin-derived or from origin site being modeled

This protocol will generate 12 medium-sized ( Jackson et al., 2019 ) 3D organotypic raft tissues, which contract over time from their initial diameter of ~10 mm to ~5 mm

Pellet the cells by centrifugation (7 min, 150 Ã g )

Resuspend in 960 Î¼l cold FBS (1 Ã 10 6 cells/ml)

It is critical that this is performed in a pre-cooled (â20Â°C freezer) 50 ml conical tube that is stored on ice.

Ensure that the collagen is neutralized prior to adding the fibroblast cells

Do not introduce air bubbles

Incubate in 37Â°C 5% CO 2 incubator for 20 min to solidify. Confirm that the dermal equivalents turn opaque.

Carefully add 400 Î¼l fibroblast growth media to each raft, along the side of the well.

Incubate overnight (~16â18 hrs) at 37Â°C, 5% CO 2

Harvest the keratinocytes as per Support Protocol 2 (Steps 6 to 13). The protocol needs 250k cells for each medium-sized raft.

Remove liquid from atop the dermal equivalents with aspiration initially (taking care not to get too close to the layer) and a pipettor to remove any remaining liquid.

Resuspend keratinocytes to 250k/50 Î¼l keratinocyte growth media.

Deposit mixed keratinocytes drop-wise on top of dermal equivalents, then rock back and forth side to side front to back, and angle in each direction to distribute. Check that keratinocytes are evenly distributed under the microscope. You should be able to focus through the dermal layer and see the basal keratinocytes seeded on top

Incubate cells 2 hr at 37Â°C 5% CO 2 to allow initial adherence of this basal keratinocyte layer

Carefully/slowly add 400 Î¼l F-media, moving around the edge of the well in a circular motion, so that loosely adherence cells wonât be washed to one side. Check by microscope to ensure that no obvious detachment of cells has occurred.

Incubate overnight at 37Â°C 5% CO 2

Pre-label 6-well plate as per experimental design.

Aliquot exactly 1.1 ml of 37Â°C differentiation media into the wells of the 6-well plate. Ensure that the media completely covers the bottom surface of each well.

In the 48-well plate, carefully remove F-media from the submerged cultures (dermal equivalent with basal layer of keratinocytes on top) by holding the plate on an angle and using a pipette (1000 Î¼l, then 200 Î¼l) to remove the liquid without disturbing the culture.

Loosen the rafts within the well by sliding a 200 Î¼l pipette tip carefully around the outside edge.

Remove excess liquid that builds up around the rafts on top the membrane shortly after lifting.

Incubate rafts at 37Â°C 5% CO 2 for 20 min, then remove any additional excess liquid that builds up around the rafts, and ensure the rafts are well-positioned and not touching each other or overlapping the edge of the membrane. Gently move them if needed with a 200 Î¼l pipette tip.

Incubate 37Â°C 5% CO 2 for the duration of the rafting experiment (1 to 3 weeks, typically 2 weeks), changing media every 48 hours.

After 48 hours, aspirate media from 6-well plates using a pipette along the side of the well, being careful not to flip the membrane insert or disrupt the rafts.

Once the rafts are ready to harvest, with 2 weeks typically sufficient for full epithelial stratification, they can be processed for downstream analyses.

Use a microspatula or forceps to carefully transfer the entire raft into 500 Î¼l of 10% buffered formalin within a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.

Incubate the raft tissue for 24 hours at room temperature to allow the fixative to permeate.

Remove the formalin and gently wash the raft twice with 500 Î¼l 70% ethanol

Photographs of the rafting process are shown in Fig. 3 .



3D organotypic raft culturing process. Rafts are prepared over an initial period of 3 days, Day 1 prepare the dermal equivalent (see photograph above of the solidified collagen-fibroblast mixture in a 48-well plate). On Day 2 the basal layer of keratinocytes is seeded atop the dermal equivalent containing active fibroblasts (note the pH color change from reddish pink to peachy orange). On Day 3 the cultures are lifted to the air-liquid interface (see photograph depicting rafts on their membranes within a 6-well plate). These lifted rafts are cultured for two weeks, changing media every 48 hrs (see photograph, depicting the rafts with visual opacity due to differentiation and stratification). Note that the rafts contract during growth (compare diameter of raft at time of lifting vs. at harvest)

This protocol describes a method to generate physiologically relevant 3D tissues using innovative rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Inside the RWV bioreactor, cells experience low physiological fluid shear conditions. The bioreactors come in two different formats, a high-aspect rotating vessel (HARV) or a slow-turning lateral vessel (STLV), in which they differ by their aeration source. Epithelial cells are mixed with collagen coated microbeads and added to the bioreactor. Following differentiation, the tissues can be harvested and used to study host-pathogen interactions. We provide details on how to culture HPV E6 and E7 immortalized, human cervical A2EN cells. However, with minor modifications, these methods can be used to create several three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models (i.e., vagina, gastrointestinal, lung, colon, placental, and neuronal) that exhibit physiologically relevant features observed in vivo ( Carterson et al., 2005 ; Hjelm et al., 2010 ; HÃ¶ner zu Bentrup et al., 2006 ; LaMarca et al., 2005 ; Myers et al., 2008 ; Nickerson et al., 2001 ).

The RWV bioreactor cell culture system provides a low fluid shear microenvironment that enables cells to form 3D cellular aggregates with in vivo -like characteristics, including tight junctions, mucin production, extracellular processes (i.e. microvilli), and cellular polarity.

Perform these procedures in a class II biosafety cabinet with laminar air flow.

This protocol is estimated to generate ~36 1 ml aliquots in two 24-well plates.

1. Detach human A2EN cervical epithelial cells cultured as monolayers from Support Protocol 4 by trypsinization as outlined in Support Protocol 4 and resuspend in 10 ml prewarmed complete KFSM medium. Add 10 Î¼l of the cell suspension to a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 Î¼l 0.4% trypan blue solution and mix gently by pipetting. Enumerate live cells by trypan blue exclusion staining.

2. Add 1Ã10 7 viable cells to the conical tube containing the prepared Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads. Carefully pour the A2EN cells and microcarrier beads into the STLV bioreactor through the central port. Seal the central port with the provided plug and incubate at 37Â°C, 5% CO 2 without rotation for 1 hour to allow A2EN cells to adhere to beads.

3. Remove plungers from the sterile syringes and resleeve plungers in their plastic wrapper to maintain sterility. Attach one 5 ml and one 10 ml syringe to the one-way stop cocks.

4. Open both stop cocks and fill the STLV bioreactor with complete KFSM medium through the 10 ml syringe.

5. Close the 5 ml syringe stop cock when the medium begins to flow into the syringe port. Continue filling with complete KFSM medium to the 10 ml syringe line. Insert both plungers and remove bubbles.

It is important to ensure all bubbles are removed from the medium within the STLV to avoid mechanical shearing of the cells from the bead surface and to promote 3D A2EN cellular aggregate formation.

6. Attach the STLV bioreactor to the rotator unit housed inside a 37Â°C incubator. Turn on the power and adjust the rotational speed to 20 rpm.

5. Allow the STLV bioreactor to incubate at 37Â°C, 20 rpm for three days without changing the culture medium. Remove bubbles daily to maximize cell attachment to microcarrier beads and minimize disruption of 3D cellular aggregate formation.

7. Unpackage new 5 ml and 10 ml syringes. Remove plungers and resleeve in their plastic wrapper to maintain sterility. Replace old syringes with new syringes.

8. Fill STLV bioreactor with fresh, prewarmed complete KFSM medium, as outlined in steps 4â5 above .

9. Reattach the STLV bioreactor to the rotating unit and resume incubation at 37Â°C, 20 rpm.

The bioreactor must be incubated with continuous rotation, except when replacing culture medium and transferring 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to the disposable HARV.

10. Replace the culture medium every other day until day 10; after day 10, replace culture medium daily until day 28 of incubation.

11. Monitor development of the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates on a weekly basis by removing ~0.2 ml of resuspended A2EN cellular aggregates from the central port using a wide-bore 1000 Î¼l pipette tip. Place 3D A2EN cellular aggregates in a small petri dish containing 0.5â1 ml of medium and visualize using an inverted light microscope.

12. After 21 days of incubation in the STLV bioreactor, unpackage a sterile disposable HARV bioreactor and remove the central plug.

12. Decontaminate the STLV surface with 70% ethanol and dry thoroughly.

13. Aspirate and discard 30 ml of spent culture medium from the STLV bioreactor.

14. Remove the central port plug and gently swirl the STLV bioreactor to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates.

15. Carefully pour the mixture into a sterile 50 ml conical tube. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.

16. Aspirate and discard ~10 ml of the upper supernatant layer. Gently swirl the 50 ml conical tube to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates.

17. Using a wide-bore 1000 Î¼l pipette, carefully transfer the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates into the disposable HARV bioreactor through the central port.

18. Collect residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates by rinsing the 50 ml conical tube walls with 10 ml of fresh prewarmed complete KFSM medium. Transfer residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to the HARV bioreactor and replace the central plug.

19. Unpackage new 5 ml and 10 ml syringes and remove plungers. Resleeve plungers in their plastic wrappers to maintain sterility. Attach syringes to the disposable HARV built-in stop cocks. Fill with prewarmed complete KFSM medium, as outlined in steps 4â5 above .

It is important to ensure all bubbles are removed from the medium within the STLV to avoid mechanical shearing of the cells from the bead surface and to promote 3D A2EN cellular aggregate formation.

20. Attach the disposable HARV bioreactor to the rotator unit and incubate at 37Â°C, 20 rpm for 7 additional days. Replace medium daily, as outlined in step 4â5 above .

21. The 3D human A2EN cellular aggregates are ready to harvest for downstream experimentation on day 28 of incubation.

22. Remove syringe plungers and aspirate and discard ~30 ml of culture medium. Remove the central port from the HARV bioreactor, gently swirl to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates, and carefully pour mixture into a sterile 50 ml conical tube.

23. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. Aspirate 10 ml of the top layer of culture medium and add to the disposable HARV bioreactor.

24. Gently swirl the disposable HARV to collect residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates and carefully pour into the 50 ml conical tube to pool the samples.

25. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.

26. Aspirate and discard the top layer of culture medium.

Perform all remaining steps with KFSM medium without Primocin added.

27. Wash 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 15 ml of KFSM medium without Primocin. Gently swirl tube to ensure 3D A2EN aggregates are thoroughly washed. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.

28. Aspirate and discard the upper layer of medium. Repeat rinse with ~40 ml of KFSM medium lacking Primocin. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.

29. Swirl 50 ml conical tube to thoroughly resuspend 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. Using a wide-bore 1000 Î¼l pipette tip, aliquot 1 ml samples into a sterile 24-well tissue-treated culture plate.

It is important to thoroughly resuspend 3D cellular aggregates before each 1 ml aliquot to ensure 3D A2EN cellular aggregates are evenly partitioned amongst the 24-well plate.

30. Halfway through the aliquot process (after transferring to 18 wells), transfer 1 ml of 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for enumerating 3D A2EN cells by trypan blue exclusion.

31. Incubate the 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing 3D A2EN cellular aggregates at 37Â°C and continue aliquoting 3D A2EN cellular aggregates into the remaining wells of both 24-well plates. When complete, incubate both 24-well plates at 37Â°C, 5% CO 2 .

32. The 3D A2EN cellular aggregates are now ready to be used for downstream assays.

33. To count the cells, aspirate and discard the upper layer of culture medium from the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 3D A2EN cellular aggregates from step 30 . Avoid transferring the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. Wash the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 1 ml of sterile D-PBS pre-warmed to 37Â°C. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle.

34. Aspirate and discard the upper layer of D-PBS, being careful not to remove the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates.

35. Treat the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 300 Î¼l of pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA to dissociate the 3D A2EN cells from the microcarrier bead matrix. Invert the tube several times to mix thoroughly. Incubate the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates at 37Â°C for 10 minutes with periodic inversion to promote detachment.

The beads will progressively look like âparticles of sandâ as the 3D A2EN cells dissociate from the microcarrier beads with continued incubation in the trypsin-EDTA solution.

36. Add pre-warmed neutralization medium to the 1.5 ml microfuge tube to the 1 ml gradient line (~500â600 Î¼l). Mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times. Allow the microcarrier beads to settle.

37. Aspirate 10 Î¼l of the A2EN cell-containing supernatant into a sterile 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 Î¼l of 0.4% trypan blue solution and gently mix by pipetting. Enumerate viable cells using an automated cell counter (e.g., Invitrogen Countess) or manually using a hemocytometer, according to the manufacturerâs instructions.

38. Utilize 3D A2EN cellular aggregates incubating in the 24-well plates for downstream experimental analysis.

A workflow diagram for generating 3D A2EN cells is shown in Fig. 4 .



Workflow diagram for generating 3D A2EN cells using RWV bioreactor technology. Downstream experimental procedures for utilizing 3D A2EN cells includes, but is not limited to, infection with bacteria or viruses, investigating compound cytotoxicity, and ultrastructural imaging using scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy.

The methods outlined in Basic Protocol 1 aim to generate tissues that accurately represent the original tissue. Routine histological assessment on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections usually involves staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. This allows for visualization of organotypic cultures. Comparison with known tissues, e.g., through the Human Protein Atlas ( http://www.proteinatlas.org , see the Normal Tissue Histology section of the Dictionary; UhlÃ©n et al., 2005 ), will allow for comparison between the organotypic tissues and their in vivo counterparts. Finally, histological assessment can be the first step in observing any morphological changes related to your experiment.

Methods for tissue embedding, sectioning, and H&E staining are beyond the scope of this protocol. We provide details on methods that will allow the reader to identify epithelial strata in their cultures, compare these structures to genuine tissues, and ultimately determine the success of their raft cultures.

H&E stained slides with permanently mounted coverslip (rafts should be cut in half, bisected, and embedded so that the open faces are orientated to allow a cross-sectional view of the epithelium, 4 Î¼m thickness, two sections per slide)

Microscope with color camera

Observe the entire epithelium for each tissue piece for histological features.

Example histology data are shown in Fig. 5 .



Histological microscope images of 3D organotypic epithelia. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained cross-sections of 3D rafts grown from (A) HPV18 negative (top) and positive (bottom) human cervical keratinocytes and (B) human tonsillar keratinocytes clearly show stratified squamous epithelial structure. Different layers of the organotypic epithelia are marked with arrows.

While H&E stained tissues provide a general idea of the histological features of these 3D cultures (Basic Protocol 3), this stain does not provide data on specific proteins that have unique expression patterns between different tissues, spatially according to the differentiation state of the tissue, or dysregulated as a result of viral activities. This protocol provides methods to characterize target proteins in 3D raft tissue using immunofluorescence on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. The conditions used here work for detecting differentiation (e.g., keratins) and viral life cycle related markers (e.g., dysregulated cell cycle proteins, such as p16), but the reader should keep in mind that conditions (e.g., as antigen-retrieval, blocking buffer composition, and antibody dilutions) may need to be optimized for a specific target of interests.

Immunofluorescence images of 3D organotypic rafts depicting protein-level confirmation of (A, B) differentiation marker keratin 10 (KRT10) and (C) HPV-induced host cell cycle dysregulation marker p16 INK4A . In panel A, KRT10 (red cytoplasmic signal) is expressed in suprabasal differentiated cells, in only the uppermost layers in cervical and tonsillar-derived 3D rafts, compared to all suprabasal cells in foreskin-derived 3D rafts as a control. The white dotted line indicates the transition from dermis to epidermis. Differential staining of cytokeratins highlights the differences between tissues derived from unique anatomic sites, such as non-keratinizing epithelium of the oral mucosa and cervix compared to keratinizing epithelium of the foreskin. Importantly, Basic Protocol 1 yields 3D organotypic raft tissues that resemble the anatomic site of origin dependent on the primary keratinocytes used.

These methods are optimized to extract total cellular (and viral) RNA from these 3D tissues (Basic Protocols 1 and 2). This RNA can be used to detect cellular and viral transcripts by qPCR (Basic Protocol 7) or used for transcriptomic analysis. Since the entire tissue is lysed, the gene expression profile will aggregate the different differentiated layers of tissue.

The RNA isolated in Support Protocol 6 can be used to detect cellular and viral transcripts by qPCR.

Here we provide an example to quantify the expression of HPV18 L1 mRNA. The L1 gene is expressed in differentiated cells, and is a marker for the switch to late viral gene expression and, presumably, virion assembly. Other viral and cellular genes can be quantified using different primer sets. The expression of many human âhousekeepingâ genes changes throughout cellular differentiation ( Steele et al., 2002 ). We detect the human PPIA (Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A) gene as a reference.

Since the entire tissue is lysed, the gene expression profile will aggregate the different layers of tissue.

The papillomavirus life cycle is intricately linked to the differentiation status of the infected tissue and cells. Therefore, the complex papillomavirus replicative cycle has been difficult to recapitulate in the laboratory. To decipher the fundamental biology of HPVs, it is essential to recapitulate the 3D structure of these tissues. Furthermore, epidemiological data strongly suggest that the nature of the infected tissue (i.e., cervix or tonsillar crypts) plays a critical role in how HPV interacts with the host ( Doorbar & Griffin, 2019 ; Roberts et al., 2019 ). This protocol provides complementary methods to establish 3D organotypic tissues representing cervical and oral epithelia. Unlike conventional monolayer cultures, both organotypic raft cultures and RWV-derived human 3D tissues recapitulate physiological architecture, such as apical and basal cell polarity, and ultrastructural features ( Asselineau & Prunieras, 1984 ; Kopan et al., 1987 ; Radtke et al., 2012 ; Radtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012 ).

Organotypic raft cultures (named due to the apparent floating nature of the cell-matrix) have been critical in deciphering different aspects of the HPV life cycle. These methods were initially developed to study skin biology and skin grafting research ( Bell et al., 1983 ; Rheinwald & Green, 1975a ), and were later adapted to study HPV. The complete life cycle of a human papillomavirus (HPV) was first elucidated in this culture system ( Dollard et al., 1992 ; McCance et al., 1988 ; Meyers et al., 1992 ). In addition to the current protocol, other, excellent organotypic raft protocols have been published and used ( Anacker & Moody, 2012 ; Lambert et al., 2005 ; Lee et al., 2016 ; Ozbun & Patterson, 2014 ; Roberts et al., 2019 ). The ability to establish these 3D organotypic raft cultures from diverse human tissues will allow researchers to study how HPV (or other pathogens) interact with these physiologically relevant tissues. Indeed, we demonstrate that once isolated, these cells maintain properties reminiscent of the initial tissue.

The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology was developed by NASA in the 1990âs to study the impact of low fluid-shear modeled microgravity environment and this methodology was found to promote cellular differentiation and faithfully recapitulate features of human tissue ( Unsworth & Lelkes, 1998 ). Cells are cultured with microcarrier beads providing an extracellular matrix for cells to attach within the low fluid-shear environment using RWV bioreactor thereby promoting cellular differentiation and formation of 3D tissue aggregates ( Gardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016 ). This culture methodology has been utilized to generate organotypic epithelial tissues from a wide variety of sites that recapitulate the in vivo architecture, barrier function, secretion of mucins, apical-basolateral polarity and transcriptional programs of in vivo tissue as reviewed extensively ( Barrila et al., 2010 ; Gardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016 ). Furthermore, the 3D RWV-derived organotypic tissues have also been utilized to study a plethora of host-microbe interactions, including throughout the female reproductive tract ( Barrila et al., 2010 , 2018 ; CrabbÃ© et al., 2017 ; Drummond et al., 2016 ; Gardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016 , 2018 ; Herbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016 ; Ilhan et al., 2020 ; Åaniewski et al., 2017 ; Nickerson et al., 2001 ; Sainz et al., 2009 ). It is becoming increasingly clear that 3D RVW-derived organoids provide researchers with advanced in vitro model systems that better resemble human in vivo tissue equivalents and are desirable when suitable animal models of infection are lacking or to complement other existing model systems.

There is currently no animal model that adequately mimics the human Lactobacillus- dominated cervicovaginal microenvironment ( Herbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016 ; Witkin & Ledger, 2012 ). Human cervical and vaginal lines derived from explanted tissues suffer from a finite life span and conventional 2D monolayer cultures fail to exhibit features of their parental in vivo tissue. The 3D RWV-derived A2EN cervical cells, on the other hand, faithfully recapitulate cellular phenotypes of in vivo tissue, such as apical and basal cellular polarity, microvilli, mucin secretion, and intracellular tight junctions ( Radtke et al., 2012 ; Radtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012 ). Human A2EN cervical cells are immortalized by stable transfection with the HPV E6 and E7 proteins, therefore providing long-term replicative capacity ( Herbst-Kralovetz et al., 2008 ). Additionally, 3D A2EN cervical models have been colonized effectively with Lactobacillus spp. and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, exposed to microbial products and challenged with pathogens and found to recapitulate clinical features of the cervicovaginal microenvironment ( Gardner et al., 2020 ; McGowin et al., 2013 ; Radtke et al., 2012 ; Winkle et al., 2016 ). Therefore, 3D RWV-derived cervical cell models described in these protocols may allow researchers to study how genital bacteria and pathogens of the cervicovaginal microenvironment influence the HPV lifecycle.

In conclusion, we provide detailed protocols on establishing and analyzing 3D tissues to study the interactions between HPV and its specific host tissues.

A successful 3D organotypic raft culture experiment requires healthy, proliferative cells. Furthermore, it is critical that researchers adhere to the stepwise process of building and lifting the rafts. Finally, these raft tissues are fragile, and careful handling throughout is essential. Both the fibroblasts and keratinocytes need to be viable to function properly for the duration of the raft procedure and should be proliferative without showing signs of senescence or transformation prior to initiating rafts. It is also critical that the appropriate media are used during each step of the procedure: EGF-containing F-media (with or without ROCK inhibition) when the basal keratinocytes are seeded. A switch to differentiation media (calcium-supplemented, without EGF and no ROCK inhibitor) is made once the tissues are lifted to the air-liquid interface. Each step of the raft process requires careful handling. When seeding the dermal equivalents you must work quickly, before the collagen-mixture solidifies, while avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. When lifting the rafts onto membranes you must take care not to break, drop, or place the cultures upside down.

With regard to the 3D RWV bioreactor-derived model system one should consider the initial set up cost of purchase the RWV bioreactor system (RLSS-4, power source, etc) and the time investment to generate fully differentiated 3D aggregates (28 days). The most critical parameters include the preparation of the beads and bioreactor, growth and health of the cells and appropriate seeding of the bioreactor. Additional parameters include close monitoring and maintenance of cells over the 28 day period. Bioreactors require media to be changed daily after a point in the protocol when the cells are consuming the nutrients as indicated by a color change in media. Following media changes, one must ensure that there are no bubbles in the bioreactor. These bubbles are removed carefully from the ports and the elimination of these bubbles are extremely important for aggregate formation. In addition, the rotation must be maintained 24 hours a day except for when changing the media. Failure to turn the rotator back, prior to differentiation and harvest, will result in a ruined batch of aggregates.
