As part of the Microbial Tracking-2 study, 94 fungal strains were isolated from surfaces on the International Space Station, and whole-genome sequences were assembled. Characterization of these draft genomes will allow evaluation of microgravity adaption, risks to human health and spacecraft functioning, and biotechnological applications of fungi.

Fungi are potential sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds during long-term spaceflight but also could affect astronaut health through both opportunistic infections and system biofouling ( 1 , 2 ). As part of a study characterizing fungal responses to the space environment, we report the draft genomes of 94 fungal strains that were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), representing 10 ascomycetous and 1 basidiomycetous species.

Aspergillus species are environmental fungi and opportunistic pathogens ( 3 ). Aspergillus unguis is a member of the ISS microbiome ( 4 ) and produces industrially important compounds ( 5 ). Aureobasidium pullulans is a black fungus that was previously isolated from the ISS water filtration system ( 6 ) and Mars mission spacecraft-associated surfaces ( 7 ).

Cladosporium species are dominant fungal contaminants in indoor air ( 8 , 9 ). Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladosporium cladosporioides were detected multiple time on the ISS, and their properties in microgravity were studied ( 10 , 11 ).

Fusarium veterinarium is a recently described species within the Fusarium oxysporum complex, the species of which are ubiquitous in soil, are known human/plant pathogens ( 12 ), and were isolated both from surfaces and from infected Zinnia hybrida plants aboard the ISS ( 13 , 14 ). Fusarium annulatum , which has been isolated from plant and human tissues on Earth, has not been reported previously in space ( 15 ).

Penicillium species produce important bioactive compounds and can contaminate food and cause secondary infections ( 16 ). Previously detected on the ISS or Mir ( 2 , 11 ) are Penicillium citrinum , a common soil and indoor species ( 17 ), Penicillium rubens , from which penicillin was isolated ( 18 ), and Penicillium corylophilum , which is commonly found in damp buildings ( 19 ). Penicillium palitans , which has been reported in cheese ( 20 ) and also in a wide range of habitats, including Antarctica ( 21 ), has not been reported previously in space.

Rhodotorula mucilaginosa is a ubiquitous environmental ( 22 ) and human commensal yeast and opportunistic pathogen ( 23 ) that is found in aquatic and built environments, including bathrooms and dishwashers ( 24 , 25 ). It is the most commonly isolated yeast on the ISS ( 26 – 28 ).

Sample collection and fungal isolation steps were described elsewhere ( 26 ). For five flight missions, eight surfaces aboard the ISS were sampled with moistened polyester wipes ( Table 1 ). Upon return to Earth, the wipes were agitated in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, which was concentrated using an InnovaPrep CP150 concentrating pipette, and suitable aliquots were spread onto nutrient media ( Table 1 ). Fungal isolates were restreaked on potato-dextrose agar (PDA), and genomic DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing libraries were prepared with an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit ( 29 ) and were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform with a S4 flow cell. After quality filtering and trimming with FastQC v0.11.7 ( 30 ) and fastp v0.20.0 ( 31 ), genomes were assembled using SPAdes v3.11.1 ( 32 ). Assembly quality was assessed with QUAST v5.0.2 ( 33 ). Fastp included screening for 512 adapters; otherwise, default settings were used for all steps.

Reference genome was not available; average sequencing depth was calculated from k -mer coverage.

Genus-level identification was made via BLAST searches against the UNITE nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) database ( 34 ). Species identification was performed using specific loci suitable for species recognition ( Table 1 ) ( 35 ). Homology searches were performed with extracted sequences against the NCBI nucleotide database and in-house Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute databases containing reference sequences; in case of doubt, identification was confirmed by constructing phylograms.

The whole-genome sequences (WGSs) and raw data have been deposited in GenBank under BioProject accession number PRJNA723004 . This project has also been deposited in the NASA GeneLab system ( 36 ) under project number GLDS-400 . The version described in this paper is the first version.

Part of the research described was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA. This research was funded by a 2014 Space Biology NNH14ZTT002N award (grant 80NSSC18K0113) to Crystal Jaing and K.V., which also partially funded postdoctoral fellowships for C.U. and J.M.W. Additionally, A.C.S. was supported by grant 80NM0018D0004, funded to K.V.

We thank astronauts Colonel Jack Fischer, Colonel Mark Vande Hei, Norishige Kanai, and Alexander Gerst for collecting samples aboard the ISS, the implementation team (Fathi Karouia) at NASA Ames Research Center for coordinating this effort, and Crystal Jaing (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), principal investigator of the team. We thank Ryan Kemp (Zymo Corp.) for extracting the DNA and Dan Butler (Weill Cornell Medicine) for generating the shotgun sequencing. The JPL supercomputing facility staff is acknowledged, notably, Narendra J. Patel (Jimmy) and Edward Villanueva, for their continuous support in providing the best possible infrastructure for BIG-DATA analysis.
