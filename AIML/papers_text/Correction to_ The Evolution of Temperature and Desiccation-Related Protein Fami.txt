This is a correction to: James F Fleming, Davide Pisani, Kazuharu Arakawa, The Evolution of Temperature and Desiccation-Related Protein Families in Tardigrada Reveals a Complex Acquisition of Extremotolerance, Genome Biology and Evolution , Volume 16, Issue 1, January 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evad217

In the originally published online version of this manuscript, details in the caption to Figure 7 were errored.

These should read: “[…]CAHS is represented in red , MAHS in purple, SAHS in green, EtAHS alpha in yellow , EtAHS beta in pink , and MRE11 in blue .[…]” instead of: “[…] CAHS is represented in blue , MAHS in purple, SAHS in green, EtAHS alpha in red , EtAHS beta in orange , and MRE11 in black .[…]”.

These errors are outlined only in this correction notice to preserve the version of record.
