Correction to: Microbiome (2018) 6:204

10.1186/s40168-018-0585-2

Following publication of the original article [ 1 ], the authors reported a typographic error in scientific notation in the number of reads, the text should read as:

“Approximately 7.3 × 10 8 reads associated with microorganisms were generated after high quality trimming from PMA (21 samples) and non-PMA treated (21 samples) samples. All metagenomics reads were normalized across all samples, which yielded 3.1 × 10 8 in total, and 7.4 × 10 6 assigned to each sample, without affecting the taxonomic diversity.”

The authors regret these errors and the inconvenience caused.
